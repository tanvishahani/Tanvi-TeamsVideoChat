# 2.  **Agile Methodology**
The following task was accomplished using Agile Methodology which is a process that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project. It is one of the simplest and effective processes to turn a vision for a business need into software solutions. Agile is a term used to describe software development approaches that employ continual planning, learning, improvement, team collaboration, evolutionary development, and early delivery. It encourages flexible responses to change.
Therefore for given project, I divided the task into four weeks of iterative improvements.
* **Week1**
  * Research, Learnt Few Basic Skills and functioning of WebRTC and Created first step for minimal requirement


* **Week2**
  * Basic Styling for decent Interface.Implemented feature to enter name, copy id to clipboard, make call from website and notification for incoming call.


* **Week3**
  * Basic UI Improvements. Added Links to share the video call ID straight from website to frequently used platforms like Outlook, Gmail and WhatsApp.
* **Week4**
  * Created a landing Login Page. Deployed Backend on Heroku and Frontend using Netlify. Debugging And Testing

# 3.  **Technologies and Libraries Used**
A few of the techonologies used were ReactJS, NodeJS, WebRTC, ExpressJS, PeerJS, socket.io etc.

* **WebRTC**
  * With WebRTC, you can add real-time communication capabilities to your application that works on top of an open standard. It supports video, voice, and generic data to be sent between peers, allowing developers to build powerful voice- and video-communication solutions. The technology is available on all modern browsers as well as on native clients for all major platforms.
   
* **React**
  * React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It helps to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application. 
# 4.  **How does the website work?**
